# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize a database for Pewlett Hackard, providing the company with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments. This analysis included information so the company could determine required preparation, including hiring new staff and developing a mentorship initiative to offset the departure of those employees retiring. The analysis determined Pewlett Hackard will encounter a substantial deficit in staff once many of the eligible employees retire.

## Results
- To organize the data, ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was utilized to visualize the relationship between the data sources and the outlining of the structure the HR department planned to take to implement the analysis. Below is the graphic used for this project:

### Employees Eligible for Retirement
- After analysis was conducted, it was determined there is currently a large number of employees at retirement age within the company. In a company of over 300,000 employees, 90,398(30%) are eligible for retirement!
- Of those employees eligible for retirement, Senior Engineers and Senior Staff account for approximately 64% of those possible retirees. See table for amount of eligible retirees in each department:

### Employees Eligible for Mentorship
- Pewlett Hackard proposed a mentorship program for upcoming retirees born in 1965, where experienced and successful employees would return to a part-time role instead of retiring completely, mentoring newly hired employees. Based on the criteria, only 1550 employees qualified. Considering less than 2% of eligible retirees qualified for mentorship, the company should consider broadening their criterion.

## Summary
Based on the Pewlett Hackard analysis, the company is potentially facing over 90,000 vacant positions due to retirements. Considering the company has the potential to lose 30% of their workforce, addressing the potential upcoming retirements, sooner rather than later, would benefit the company. The mentorship program is helpful, but as is, not enough. My recommendation would be to broaden the mentorship criterion to include more potential retirees, thus slowing the exodus of retirees and improving the training of the new, replacement hires.
