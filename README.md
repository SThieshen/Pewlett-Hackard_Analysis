# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize a database for Pewlett Hackard, providing the company with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working there. This analysis included information so the company could determine required preparation for those retiring, including hiring new staff and developing a mentorship initiative. 

The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.
