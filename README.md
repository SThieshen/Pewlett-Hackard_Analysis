# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize a database for Pewlett Hackard, providing the company with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working there. This analysis included information so the company could determine required preparation, including hiring new staff and developing a mentorship initiative to offset the departure of those employees retiring, as the analysis determined Pewlett Hackard will encounter a substantial deficit in staff once a majority of the eligible employees retire.

## Results
- To organize the data, ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was utilized to visualize the relationship between the data sources and the outlining of the structure the HR department planned to take to implement the analysis. Below is the graphic used for this project:
